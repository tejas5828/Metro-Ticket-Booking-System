🚇 Metro Ticket Booking System | C Programming Project

I’m excited to share my Metro Ticket Booking System, a console-based application developed using C programming, which simulates a real-world metro ticket booking and management system.

🔹 Project Description:
The Metro Ticket Booking System is designed to manage metro ticket operations through a secure login-based workflow. The system allows users to book tickets, view ticket details, cancel tickets using a login name and ticket number, and delete customer records. It uses file handling to store and manage customer and ticket information efficiently.

🔹 Key Functionalities:
✔User Registration (New customer onboarding)
✔ User login system
✔ Ticket booking with source & destination selection
✔ Automatic fare calculation
✔ Display ticket details 
✔ Cancel ticket based on login credentials & cancel it with ticket number
✔ Delete customer records
✔ File-based data storage
✔ Menu-driven interface for smooth navigation

🔹 Technologies & Concepts Used:

-> C Programming

-> Structures & Functions

-> File Handling

-> Conditional Statements & Loops

-> Command Line Interface (CLI)

🔹 Learning Outcome:
This project helped me gain practical experience in building a complete application using C. I improved my understanding of login-based systems, record management using files, modular coding, and real-world problem-solving.
